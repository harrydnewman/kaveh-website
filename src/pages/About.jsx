                <p>I present three poems in conversation with one another; where I dissect my experiences of queerness, immigration, of isolation and belonging, using a digital documentation of colour and shape as my medium of expression. My short film trilogy serves as a video diary, presented in the form of a collage.</p>
                <p>The works negate the necessity of a specific time and place.</p>
                <p>You may choose your own timeline, and decide for yourself how you want to meet me.</p>
